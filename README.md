## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16 or higher
- Hardhat development framework
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Mobile money integration API keys

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/defi-microlending

# Install dependencies
cd defi-microlending
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

### Configuration
1. Configure smart contract parameters in `config/lending.json`
2. Set up mobile money API credentials
3. Configure risk assessment parameters
4. Set minimum/maximum loan amounts
5. Define interest rate ranges

### Deployment
```bash
# Deploy smart contracts
npx hardhat deploy --network [network-name]

# Initialize reputation system
npx hardhat run scripts/init-reputation.js

# Start backend services
npm run start:services

# Launch frontend
npm run start:frontend
```

## Smart Contract Interaction

### For Borrowers
```solidity
// Request a loan
function requestLoan(uint256 amount, uint256 duration) external;

// Make repayment
function makeRepayment(uint256 loanId, uint256 amount) external;

// Check loan status
function getLoanStatus(uint256 loanId) external view returns (LoanStatus);
```

### For Lenders
```solidity
// Fund a loan
function fundLoan(uint256 loanId) external payable;

// Check borrower reputation
function checkBorrowerScore(address borrower) external view returns (uint256);
```

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
